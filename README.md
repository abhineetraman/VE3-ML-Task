## Features

- Predicts California house prices using 8 input features.
- Interactive web interface for user input and displaying predictions.
- REST API endpoint for programmatic predictions.
- Model training pipeline with hyperparameter tuning.
- Clean and responsive UI with Bootstrap.

## Project Structure

- **app.py**: Main Flask application serving the web interface and API.
- **model.pkl**: Trained Random Forest model (generated by `classification.py`).
- **requirements.txt**: Python dependencies.
- **run.sh**: Shell script to set up and run the app.
- **applications/classification.py**: Script for data loading, preprocessing, model training, and saving.
- **templates/index.html**: HTML template for the web interface.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```sh
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd VE3-ML-Task
    ```
2. **Run the setup script**
This will create a virtual environment, install dependencies, and start the Flask app:
 > bash run.sh

3. **Access the app**
Open your browser and go to:
http://localhost:5000

**Usage**
Enter values for the following features:

Median Income (MedInc)
House Age (HouseAge)
Average Rooms (AveRooms)
Average Bedrooms (AveBedrms)
Population (Population)
Average Occupancy (AveOccup)
Latitude (Latitude)
Longitude (Longitude)
Click Submit.
The predicted house price will be displayed below the form.

**Model Details**
Dataset: California Housing dataset from scikit-learn.
Features:
MedInc, HouseAge, AveRooms, AveBedrms, Population, AveOccup, Latitude, Longitude
Model: Random Forest Regressor
Preprocessing:
Numerical features: Median imputation, standard scaling.
No categorical features in this dataset.
Hyperparameter Tuning: RandomizedSearchCV with cross-validation.
The model is trained and saved as model.pkl by running classification.py.

**API Endpoints**
POST /api/data
Description: Returns a house price prediction for the provided input features.
Request Body: JSON object with the following keys:

```json
{
  "MedInc": 8.3252,
  "HouseAge": 41.0,
  "AveRooms": 6.9841,
  "AveBedrms": 1.0238,
  "Population": 322.0,
  "AveOccup": 2.5556,
  "Latitude": 37.88,
  "Longitude": -122.23
}
```
**Customization**
To retrain or tune the model, edit and run classification.py.
To change the web interface, modify index.html.
To add new features or endpoints, edit app.py.
